# Openwater BloodFlow Gen1 Device Hardware

The Generation 1 Stroke Detection Device is the first in a series of prototypes developed to measure blood flow in the brain of a human.  Data from Generation 1 Stroke Detection Device testing in human studies informed design changes to subsequent prototypes.

## Getting Started
Before getting started with the design data included in this repo, you may want to visit the Gen 2 Blood Flow Hardware Wiki for some background information on the system and its design. You may also want to review the See the [Openwater Blood Flow Gen 1 Software](link) and [Openwater Blood Flow Gen 1 Analysis](link) repos for additional information about the system and its operation. 

## Features

- Measure and display blood flow index and blood volume index
- Included a hand held wand, so many places on the scalp could be measured to identify the most important areas with data
- Data processed on the embedded computer
- movable cart for hospital environment

## Files located in the repo
There are two folders located in the “Gen 1 hardware repo”

The first folder is called Gen 1 hw repo is the general document storage that contains released documents describing the Gen 1B device.  The files are mostly in a pdf format for viewing.

The second folder is called cad sub assemblies, this folder contains e-drawings or compressed solid models that can be viewed with a free download, see link below to get the viewer.  
<https://www.edrawingsviewer.com/view-cad-files-free>

These models comprise the custom assemblies that were designed to meet the specific requirements.

Some of the detail for the Gen 1B device is omitted because there are improved versions of the entire device and subassemblies readily available in the Gen 2 repo.  The Gen 2 device was fully documented and was designed as the manufacturable replacement for the Gen 1B prototype device. 

## Prerequisites

Various assembly and test equipment items are needed to build the blood flow device. See repo for test and calibration equipment.

## Usage

See the Openwater repo for Software, for User Manual.
