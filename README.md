Gen 1 Blood Flow Hardware



# Openwater Generation 1 Blood Flow Device

The Generation 1 Stroke Detection Device is the first in a series of prototypes developed to measure blood flow in the brain of a human.  Data from Generation 1 Stroke Detection Device testing in human studies will inform design changes to subsequent prototypes.

## Features

- Measure and display blood flow index and blood volume index
- Included a hand held wand, so many places on the scalp could be meausred
- Data retrieval was process on the embedded computer
- movable cart 

## Gen 1 to gen 1B device

After use in the hospital setting we received input that the Gen 1 device was too hard to move into small the small rooms needed for patient measurement.  The Gen 1B deviced was re-configured to take up less floor space, in addition the laser source module was miniturized and reduced in cost in preparation for a Gen 2 system that would mount to an IV pole.
