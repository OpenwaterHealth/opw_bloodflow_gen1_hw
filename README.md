Gen 1 Blood Flow Hardware



# Openwater Generation 1 Blood Flow Device

The Generation 1 Stroke Detection Device is the first in a series of prototypes developed to measure blood flow in the brain of a human.  Data from Generation 1 Stroke Detection Device testing in human studies informed design changes to subsequent prototypes.

## Features

- Measure and display blood flow index and blood volume index
- Included a hand held wand, so many places on the scalp could be measured to identify the most important areas with data
- Data processed on the embedded computer
- movable cart for hospital environment


## Gen 1 to gen 1B device

The first device sent to a hospital was called a Blood flow Gen 1 cart, This device was approved by the hospital principal investigator and IRB.  After use in the hospital setting we received input that the Gen 1 device was too hard to move into the small rooms needed for patient measurement.  The Gen 1B device was developed as being a are-configured device that would  take up less floor space, in addition the laser source module was miniaturized and cost reduced in preparation for a Gen 2 system that would mount to an IV pole.   The Gen 1B device yielded important information on the use with a clinically significant population and operated by research coordinators or nurse practitioners in a hospital. 

Inside the repository for Gen 1B are visual details of the device in both solid model form and actual photos.  The Gen 2 device is more completely detailed and is essentially an improved version.  The Gen 1B device was made up of large off the shelf general components, whereas the Gen 2 device used more customized components that were smaller and less expensive to make.

The data produced from the Gen 1B is included in the blood flow Gen 1 analysis repo.
One of the most significant hardware results from Gen 1B involved finding design criteria to move from a wand based design to a static headset design.  Holding the sensitive wand manually on the patient's head yielded inconsistent measurement.  With the wand we could interrogate everywhere on the scalp, with a headset we would only look at a few positions.

For the highest percentage of patients, the best data was found to come from areas on the scalp with no or few hair follicles (or the forehead area).  A second study was launched to look at 32 possible positions on the forehead which included left and right hemispheres.  The results of the forehead study informed a design for the headset used in Gen 2.

## files located in the repo
There are two folders located in the “Gen 1 hardware repo”

The first folder is called Gen 1 hw repo is the general document storage that contains released documents describing the Gen 1B device.  The files are mostly in a pdf format for viewing.

The second folder is called cad sub assemblies, this folder contains e-drawings or compressed solid models that can be viewed with a free download, see link below to get the viewer.  
<https://www.edrawingsviewer.com/view-cad-files-free>

These models comprise the custom assemblies that were designed to meet the specific requirements.

Some of the detail for the Gen 1B device is omitted because there are improved versions of the entire device and subassemblies readily available in the Gen 2 repo.  The Gen 2 device was fully documented and was designed as the manufacturable replacement for the Gen 1B prototype device. 

### Prerequisites

Various assembly and test equipment items are needed to build the blood flow device. See repo for test and calibration equipment.

### Usage

See the Openwater repo for Software, for User Manual.
